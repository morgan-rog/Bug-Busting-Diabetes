        K Neighbors Classifier (machine learning model):
        - The K-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric classification method
        and is used for classification and regression.

        Support Vector Machine (machine learning model):
        - Support Vector Machines are machine learning models that analyze data for classification

        - The SVM takes the set of training values from the diabetes dataset with 2 classifications
        (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes) and assigns new examples to one category or the other.
        SVM maps training examples to points in space so it can maximize the width of the gap between
        the two categories.
